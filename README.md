## üìñ Project Overview

This project leverages data analytics and machine learning to create a user-friendly dashboard for healthcare predictions. Using historical patient data, the app predicts health outcomes, providing valuable insights into patient risk factors and supporting healthcare decision-making.

The dashboard is built with Streamlit and includes:
- Data exploration and visualization tools.
- A machine learning model that predicts healthcare outcomes.
- An intuitive interface for interactive user experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Features

- **Data Visualization**: Display patient demographics and health metrics to explore trends and distributions.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses a trained machine learning model to predict health outcomes based on input data.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for seamless navigation and interaction.
